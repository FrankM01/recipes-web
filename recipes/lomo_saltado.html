                <p>Stir fry with French fries? You bet!! Thatâ€™s how this Peruvian beef stir fry is served. Lomo Saltado
                    is a beautiful fusion of Peruvian and Asian cuisine, and the ingredients work so well together to
                    make this national favorite.

                    Lomo Saltado, one of Peruâ€™s most traditional and beloved dishes, blends succulent sirloin steak,
                    vibrant bell peppers, and juicy tomatoes in a sizzling stir fry. Our marinade adds depth and savory
                    flavors to the steak, which is then seared to perfection.

                    The stir fry sauce, featuring Aji Amarillo paste, adds a deliciously fiery kick. The dish is
                    finished off with fresh cilantro for a touch of brightness and served atop a comforting bed of rice
                    and crispy French fries.</p>

                <h2>Recipe:</h2>
                <ol class="recipes">
                    <li><b>Marinate the Steak:</b> In a bowl, marinate steak strips with soy sauce, cumin, oregano, and
                        pepper while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</li>
                    <li><b>Make the Stir Fry Sauce:</b> Combine Aji Amarillo paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and a dash of
                        salt in a small bowl and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Sear the Steak:</b> Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large skillet or a wok over high heat. Add the
                        steak
                        strips and cook, stirring frequently, until browned and seared, approximately 3-4 minutes.
                        Ensure the pan isnâ€™t overcrowded, if needed, sear the steak in batches. Once cooked, remove from
                        the pan and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Stir-fry the Veggies:</b> In the same pan (add more oil if needed), stir fry the sliced
                        onions and bell peppers for a couple of minutes, or until they start to soften. Add in the
                        ginger and garlic and stir fry for another minute. Add the tomato slices to the pan and stir fry
                        for 30 seconds.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Finish the Stir Fry:</b> Return the steak, along with its juices, to the pan. Stir in the
                        stir fry sauce and mix everything well for a minute. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve
                        immediately over rice and French fries. (Optionally, you can add the French fries into the stir
                        fry and mix well before serving.)</li>
