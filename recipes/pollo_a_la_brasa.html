                <h2>Recipe:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour 4 tablespoons of salt in a large pot with water and stir well.</li>
                    <li>Immerse the whole chicken and refrigerate in brine for 8 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chop the rosemary as finely as possible and place in a bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the black pepper and a teaspoon of salt. Add the cumin, the sidano, the oregano, the ground
                        garlic, the aji panca bell pepper and the black beer. Mix and correct the salt. Reserve this
                        marinade.</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator, drain it and place it in a clean bowl.</li>
                    <li>Coat it with the marinade. Try to introduce the mixture between the skin and the meat. Cover the
                        bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least eight more hours with the breast side down.
                        Turn it over a couple of hours before taking it out.</li>
                    <li>Once the time has elapsed, place the chicken in a tray or baking dish and brush it with butter
                        on top and inside the skin.</li>
                    <li>Cook in the oven at 270 ÂºC for 90 minutes (or 120 minutes if the chicken is very cold).</li>
                    <li>After the first 40 minutes, bathe it with the juice left from the marinade. Turn the tray 3 or 4
                        times during cooking so that it cooks evenly.</li>
                    <li>Brush again with melted butter about 20 minutes before removing. Watch constantly. Remove from
                        the oven before the skin begins to brown or burn.</li>
