                <ol class="recipes">
                    <li><b>Boil eggs the Ina Garten way:</b> Place the eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to
                        cover.
                        Bring the water to a boil and immediately turn off the heat. Let the eggs sit in the pan for 15
                        minutes. Remove the eggs to a bowl and allow to rest for at least 2 minutes. When the eggs are
                        cool enough to handle, crack the eggs on each side and then roll them back and forth with your
                        hand, breaking up the shell. Remove and discard the shell. Place in fridge to cool.</li>
                    <li><b> Boil chicken â€“</b> place chicken in a saucepan and cover chicken with water. Place lid on
                        saucepan
                        and place over medium heat to cook for about 20 minutes or until the chicken easy shreds apart,
                        about 165-170 degree internal temperature. Shred chicken with two forks and set aside for later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rinse out saucepan and place peeled potatoes in the pan and cover with water. Place lid on
                        saucepan and place back over medium heat to cook for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are
                        fork tender. Drain and rinse. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place a large saute pan over medium heat. Add ghee to the pan along with onion and garlic. Cook
                        until onion becomes translucent, about 2 minutes, then add the turmeric and cumin and mix until
                        spices become fragrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add coconut milk along with the ajÃ­ paste and a pinch of salt and black pepper and whisk
                        together until completely combine. Let simmer and reduce for about 10 minutes. It should reduce
                        by about 1/3, remove from heat and let cool for about 5 minutes. Add the mixture to a high speed
                        blender then add in the mayo and blend for about 30 seconds, until smooth.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour mixture back into the saute pan over medium heat then add in the shredded chicken and mix
                        to combine and let simmer for about 3 more minutes to heat through.</li>
                    <li>Serve the chicken with fresh cilantro on top and sliced eggs and potatoes on the side. I also
                        listed other sides that go great with this dish! Feel free to play around with it yourself!</li>
